# Programming Languages Popularity Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the popularity trends of various programming languages using a dataset exported from Stack Overflow.  
The notebook performs exploratory data analysis to understand:

- How usage of different programming languages changes over time  
- Which languages are gaining or losing popularity  
- High-level insights about developer preferences

## Analysis Tools
This notebook uses **Pandas** for data loading, cleaning, and exploration, and **Matplotlib** for visualizing programming language popularity trends through charts and plots.
